AncesTree: an interactive immunoglobulin lineage tree visualizer
=============
AncesTree is a Graphic User Interface (GUI) that displays immunoglobulin lineage trees processed by dnaml from PHYLIP package or by IgPhyML (https://igphyml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html).

AncesTree is distributed as a cross-platform application (jar file) that can run under Windows, Linux and Mac OS. 

It only needs Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 12, 13, 14 or 15 (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk15-archive-downloads.html).
**!! WARNING it does NOT work with latest JAVA JRE 16 !!**

### RUNNING AncesTree ###
   
#     
   
- **Launch AncesTree GUI.**
    After downloading AncesTree.jar from [release page](https://github.com/MathildeFogPerez/ancestree/releases), in a terminal:
    
       ```
       java -jar AncesTree.jar
       ```
#     
  
- **Loading the file of interest.**
    To run AncesTree, there are two options:
    - a dnaml output file from Phylip package is needed, it is a text file that contains a phylogenic tree and the theoretical reconstructed sequences. Optionally , a fasta file can be loaded to get all AncesTree features available.The file should contain the UCA (Unmutated Common Ancestor) sequence in IMGT format and its related CDR/FR regions boundaries.  
    - a change-O in AIRR format file (https://changeo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html) and its related IgPhyML files (tab and fasta).
   
#     
   
- **Interaction with phylogenic tree.**
    Once the tree is displayed in the GUI, the user can interact with the tree:

    * Get information about a node (an Ig or a theoretical reconstructed sequence)
    * Get information about the mutations between the nodes : nucleotide or amino acid (Kabat numbering)
    * Visualize the alignment between the sequence using different mode: nucleotide, amino acid by chemistry or amino acid by highlighting mode 
    * Visualize [BASELINe](http://selection.med.yale.edu/baseline/) output which estimates positive and negative selection from immunoglobulin sequences
